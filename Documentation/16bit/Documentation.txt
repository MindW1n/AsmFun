____________________________AsmFun__16_bit__Documentation__________________________________

These type of functions is basically for the operating system development. Its not gonna be
useful in for example Linux. So you can omit the them if you want. But definately check 64
bit version of AsmFun. Its insane!

Here's a list of 16 bit Asm functions for your system development pleasure:

1. _diskLoad
        Purpose:
                Loads ax sectors to es : bx from drive dl

        Output:
                - ah is modified

		- cx is modified

		- si is modified

		- dh is modified
		
		- di is modified

        Dependencies:
                Code:
                        %include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/DiskLoad/main.asm"

		Resourses:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/DiskLoadRes/main.asm"

2. FatFS: this is not a function! Put this include above of all of your code and you'll get
a basic fat12 headers in your bootloader.

	Dependencies:
		Resourses:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/FatFS/main.asm"

3. _fatKernelLoad
	Purpose:
		This is a mess and I want you not to use it but it checks in a fat12 filesystem
		if there is a kernel and loads it into memory.

	Input:
		- nothing

	Output:
		- a complete mess but kernel is loaded if it exists (I don't want to analyse this
		because it isn't mine, I copypasted it from youtube).

	Dependencies:
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/FatKernelLoad/main.asm"

4. GDTLM: this is not a function. This is a file that contains General Description Table for jumping into
Long Mode. Put this include if you want to use it:
		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/GDTLM/main.asm"

5. GDTPM: this is not a function. This is a file that contains General Description Table for jumping into
Long Mode. Put this include if you want to use it:
                %include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/GDTPM/main.asm"

6. _lbaDiskLoad:
	Purpose:
		This is not mine and I'm not responsible but it probably converts lba adress (check wikipedia) 
		to chs address and loads memory from disk.
	
	Input:
		- ax as an lba adress

		- cl is amount of sectors to read (up to 128)

		- dl is a drive number

		- es:bx is a memory adress where to store read data	
	Output:
		- I don't want to analyse this because it's code from internet, sorry :(

	Dependencies:	
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/LbaDiskLoad/main.asm"

7. _newLine:
	Purpose:
		Puts the cursor on the screen to the next line

	Input:
		- dh is a current page

	Output:
		- ah equals to 02h
	
		- dl equals to 0
	
		- dh is incremented

	Dependencies:
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/NewLine/main.asm"

8. _print:
	Purpose:
		Prints a line on a screen

	Input:
		- si is a pointer to screen
	
	Output:
		- string is printed

	Dependencies:
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/PrintText/main.asm"

9. SwitchToLM: not a function but a whole block of code that prepares system to jump to Long Mode
and does it.

	Input:	
		- nothing 
	
	Output:
		- landed in long mode

	Dependencies:
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/SwitchToLM/main.asm"

10. SwitchToPM: not a function but a whole block of code that prepares system to jump to Protected Mode
and does it.

        Input:
                - nothing

        Output:
                - landed in protected mode

        Dependencies:
                Code:
                        %include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/SwitchToPM/main.asm"

11. _waitForKeyAndReboot:
	Purpose:
		This function waits for user key enter and reboots the whole system

	Input:
		- nothing

	Output:
		- system is presumed to reboot

	Dependencies:
		Code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Headers16bit/WaitForKeyAndReboot/main.asm"

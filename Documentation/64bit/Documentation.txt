			AsmFun module

AsmFun is assembler functions for more convinient coding in nasm

List of all functions and their purpose for you coding pleasure:

1. _add0

	Purpose:
		This function adds 0 code in ASCII [NULL] to the string pointer.
		You will need to do this for _print cause it counts the
		string to that character.	

	Input: 
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- String in rdi pointer is modified
		al is modified

	Dependency: 
		If you want to use this function you have to put this line 
		of code into the end of your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Add0/main.asm"

2. _addMinus

	Purpose:
		This function adds "-" character (45 in ASCII) to the string pointer.

	Input:
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- string being pointed by is modified
		
		- rdi is incremented
		
		- bl equals to 45

	Dependency:
		Put this line of code into your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/AddMinus/main.asm"

3. _addNewLineCharacter

	Purpose:
		This function add "\n" character (10 in ASCII) to the string pointer.

	Input:
		- rdi as a pointer to memory

	Output:
		- string being pointed by rdi is modified
		
		- bl equals to 10
		
		- rdi is incremented

	Dependency:
		Put this line of code into your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/AddNewLineCharacter/main.asm"

4. _assignFlippedIntegerPortion

	Purpose:
		Gets a string that is the flipped integer portion of a number in rax.
		Serves for the function _intToString. It also can be used for 
		number systems converstion if you want it to. 
	
	Input:
		- rax as an integer
	
		- rdi as a pointer to string
	
		- rbx is a devider (for decimal it must be 10)

	Output:
       		- rdx is modified
	
		- rdi points to the end of the destination string
	
		- rax equals to 0

		- string being pointed by rdi is modified

		- rbx remains the same

	Dependency:
       		Put this line of code into your nasm code:
               		%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/AssignFlippedIntegerPortion/main.asm"

5. _break

	Purpose:
		Returns from the subroutine (your function)

	Input:
		Offset in the code sector (call saves it in stack automatically)

	Output:
		Returns from function

	Dependency:
		Put this line of code into your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/Break/main.asm"

6. _flipString

	Purpose:
		This function takes the content of a string,
		flips it and puts it into the string pointer.

	Input:
		- rsi as a pointer to the source string
		
		- rdi as a pointer to the destination string 

	Output:
		- rsi remains the same

		- rdi points to the end of the destination string

		- r8 equals to rsi

		- rax is modified

		- source string remains
		the same

		- destination string is a 
		flipped source string

	Dependencies:
		These lines of code are going to require those lines
		in your nasm code:
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/FlipTemp/main.asm" - this you have to put right in
		the end of your code
			%include "<Your_path_to_AsmFun>/TempRes/main.asm" - this you're gonna wanna
		put in the beginning of your nasm code


7. _floatToString _____________TODO___________

	Purpose:
		Converts floating point number into string and puts it to string pointer
	
	Input:
	
	OutPut:

	Dependency:
	
		  _____________TODO____________

8. _getDebugString

	Purpose:
		Generates string that contains info about all registers (their values I mean)

	Input:
		You just leave registers as they are

	Output:
		Debug string is going to be printed on the screen. All of your registers
		except rsi are safe (the reason why rsi is not safe is that we put there 
		a point to the string being printed).
